### A smart street light system equipped with sensors to automatically turn on/off lights based on movement and light sensitivity
Smart street light systems, which incorporate advanced technologies such as Arduino Uno, Light Dependent Resistor, and Infrared sensors (abbreviated as LDR and IR sensors, respectively), have become a popular solution for efficient and sustainable urban lighting. The Arduino Uno microcontroller plays a crucial role in controlling and coordinating the various components used in the smart street light system. The LDR, also known as a photo resistor, is an essential component of the smart street light system as it detects changes in ambient light levels and is used to determine whether the street lights should be turned on or off. The IR sensors, on the other hand, are used to detect the presence of objects within the vicinity of the street lights. When high intensity light falls on the LDR, it sends a signal to the Arduino Uno, which then turns off the street lights during daytime. 
In the absence of light, the output of the LDR changes, causing the Arduino Uno to turn on the street lights. The proposed prototype of the smart street light system incorporates four IR sensors, which are responsible for detecting objects. These IR sensors consist of an IR transmitter that emits infrared rays and an IR receiver that detects the reflected rays when an object comes within range
